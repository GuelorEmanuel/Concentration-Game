Overall the assignment process went great, it was a very good experience working with Casey Crooke. 
We were able to divide the work evenly and work effectively throughout the entire project. The only 
problem we ran into was with drop box, since drop box doesn’t have any way to manage two people working 
on the fame file  most of our files got corrupted but we managed to get around it by working on separate tabs.
I would work with Case Crooke again because we were able to work to communicate with one another without any problem, 
and were able to tackle the assignment with ease.
